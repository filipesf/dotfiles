A Solarized theme (and color scheme) for Sublime Text 2.

## Installation

To install in Sublime Text 2, ```$ cd``` into your Packages directory. If you're on a Mac, this is probably something like:

```bsh
$ cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages
```

Then clone the repo:

```bsh
$ git clone git@github.com:paulcpederson/solarized-sublime.git Theme\ -\ Solarized/
```

The ```Theme\ -\ Solarized/``` bit just names the folder "Theme - Solarized" to keep it inline with Sublime Text's theme naming conventions.

Then add two lines to your user preferences file (Preferences > Settings - User):

```
"color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Solarized/Solarized (dark).tmTheme",
"theme": "Solarized Dark.sublime-theme"
```

When you save the file, it should automatically change the theme.

## TODO
This is an active project, and there are still a lot of assets to be made. Because this was forked from the wonderful Soda theme, assets that are yet to be completed will just look like the Soda Assets.

See the two issues to monitor progress on the themes.
