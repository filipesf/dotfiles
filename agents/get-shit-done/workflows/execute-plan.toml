Analyze execution strategy:**\n\n**If NO checkpoints found:**\n\n- **Fully autonomous plan** - spawn single subagent for entire plan\n- Subagent gets fresh 200k context, executes all tasks, creates SUMMARY, commits\n- Main context: Just orchestration (~5% usage)\n\n**If checkpoints found, parse into segments:**\n\nSegment = tasks between checkpoints (or start→first checkpoint, or last checkpoint→end)\n\n**For each segment, determine routing:**\n\n```\nSegment routing rules:\n\nIF segment has no prior checkpoint:\n  → SUBAGENT (first segment, nothing to depend on)\n\nIF segment follows checkpoint:human-verify:\n  → SUBAGENT (verification is just confirmation, doesn't affect next work)\n\nIF segment follows checkpoint:decision OR checkpoint:human-action:\n  → MAIN CONTEXT (next tasks need the decision/result)\n```\n\n**3.

Why segment:** Fresh context per subagent preserves peak quality. Main context stays lean (~15% usage).\n\n**5. Implementation:**\n\n**For fully autonomous plans:**\n\n```\n1. Run init_agent_tracking step first (see step below)\n\n2.

[Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed case-sensitive email uniqueness constraint**\n\n- **Found during:** Task 4 (Follow/unfollow API implementation)\n- **Issue:** User.email unique constraint was case-sensitive - Test@example.com and test@example.com were both allowed, causing duplicate accounts\n- **Fix:** Changed to `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX users_email_unique ON users (LOWER(email))`\n- **Files modified:** src/models/User.ts, migrations/003_fix_email_unique.sql\n- **Verification:** Unique constraint test passes - duplicate emails properly rejected\n- **Commit:** abc123f\n\n**2. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Added JWT expiry validation to auth middleware**\n\n- **Found during:** Task 3 (Protected route implementation)\n- **Issue:** Auth middleware wasn't checking token expiry - expired tokens were being accepted\n- **Fix:** Added exp claim validation in middleware, reject with 401 if expired\n- **Files modified:** src/middleware/auth.ts, src/middleware/auth.test.ts\n- **Verification:** Expired token test passes - properly rejects with 401\n- **Commit:** def456g\n\n---\n\n**Total deviations:** 4 auto-fixed (1 bug, 1 missing critical, 1 blocking, 1 architectural with approval)\n**Impact on plan:** All auto-fixes necessary for correctness/security/performance.

Check test infrastructure (if first TDD plan):**\nIf no test framework configured:\n- Detect project type from package.json/requirements.txt/etc.\n- Install minimal test framework (Jest, pytest, Go testing, etc.)\n- Create test config file\n- Verify: run empty test suite\n- This is part of the RED phase, not a separate task\n\n**2. RED - Write failing test:**\n- Read `<behavior>` element for test specification\n- Create test file if doesn't exist (follow project conventions)\n- Write test(s) that describe expected behavior\n- Run tests - MUST fail (if passes, test is wrong or feature exists)\n- Commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`\n\n**3. GREEN - Implement to pass:**\n- Read `<implementation>` element for guidance\n- Write minimal code to make test pass\n- Run tests - MUST pass\n- Commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`\n\n**4. REFACTOR (if needed):**\n- Clean up code if obvious improvements\n- Run tests - MUST still pass\n- Commit only if changes made: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`\n\n**Commit pattern for TDD plans:**\nEach TDD plan produces 2-3 atomic commits:\n1. `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for X`\n2. `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement X`\n3. `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up X` (optional)\n\n**Error handling:**\n- If test doesn't fail in RED phase: Test is wrong or feature already exists. Investigate before proceeding.\n- If test doesn't pass in GREEN phase: Debug implementation, keep iterating until green.\n- If tests fail in REFACTOR phase: Undo refactor, commit was premature.\n\n**Verification:**\nAfter TDD plan completion, ensure:\n- All tests pass\n- Test coverage for the new behavior exists\n- No unrelated tests broken\n\n**Why TDD uses dedicated plans:** TDD requires 2-3 execution cycles (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR), each with file reads, test runs, and potential debugging. This consumes 40-50% of context for a single feature. Dedicated plans ensure full quality throughout the cycle.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Standard plans: Multiple tasks, 1 commit per task, 2-4 commits total\n- TDD plans: Single feature, 2-3 commits for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle\n\nSee `/Users/filipefernandes/.gemini/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md` for TDD plan structure.\n</tdd_plan_execution>\n\n<task_commit>\n## Task Commit Protocol\n\nAfter each task completes (verification passed, done criteria met), commit immediately:\n\n**1. Identify modified files:**\n\nTrack files changed during this specific task (not the entire plan):\n\n```bash\ngit status --short\n```\n\n**2. Stage only task-related files:**\n\nStage each file individually (NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`):\n\n```bash\n# Example - adjust to actual files modified by this task\ngit add src/api/auth.ts\ngit add src/types/user.ts\n```\n\n**3. Determine commit type:**\n\n| Type | When to Use | Example |\n|------|-------------|---------|\n| `feat` | New feature, endpoint, component, functionality | feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint |\n| `fix` | Bug fix, error correction | fix(08-02): correct email validation regex |\n| `test` | Test-only changes (TDD RED phase) | test(08-02): add failing test for password hashing |\n| `refactor` | Code cleanup, no behavior change (TDD REFACTOR phase) | refactor(08-02): extract validation to helper |\n| `perf` | Performance improvement | perf(08-02): add database index for user lookups |\n| `docs` | Documentation changes | docs(08-02): add API endpoint documentation |\n| `style` | Formatting, linting fixes | style(08-02): format auth module |\n| `chore` | Config, tooling, dependencies | chore(08-02): add bcrypt dependency |\n\n**4. Craft commit message:**\n\nFormat: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {task-name-or-description}`\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"{type}({phase}-{plan}): {concise task description}\n\n- {key change 1}\n- {key change 2}\n- {key change 3}\n\"\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Standard plan task\ngit commit -m \"feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint\n\n- POST /auth/register validates email and password\n- Checks for duplicate users\n- Returns JWT token on success\n\"\n\n# Another standard task\ngit commit -m \"fix(08-02): correct email validation regex\n\n- Fixed regex to accept plus-addressing\n- Added tests for edge cases\n\"\n```\n\n**Note:** TDD plans have their own commit pattern (test/feat/refactor for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR phases). See `<tdd_plan_execution>` section above.\n\n**5. Record commit hash:**\n\nAfter committing, capture hash for SUMMARY.md:\n\n```bash\nTASK_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)\necho \"Task ${TASK_NUM} committed: ${TASK_COMMIT}\"\n```\n\nStore in array or list for SUMMARY generation:\n```bash\nTASK_COMMITS+=(\"Task ${TASK_NUM}: ${TASK_COMMIT}\")\n```\n\n</task_commit>\n\n<step name=\"checkpoint_protocol\">\nWhen encountering `type=\"checkpoint:*\"`:\n\n**Critical: Claude automates everything with CLI/API before checkpoints.** Checkpoints are for verification and decisions, not manual work.\n\n**Display checkpoint clearly:**\n\n```\n╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\n║  CHECKPOINT: [Type]                                   ║\n╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝\n\nProgress: {X}/{Y} tasks complete\nTask: [task name]\n\n[Display task-specific content based on type]\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n→ YOUR ACTION: [Resume signal instruction]\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n\n**For checkpoint:human-verify (90% of checkpoints):**\n\n```\nBuilt: [what was automated - deployed, built, configured]\n\nHow to verify:\n  1.
